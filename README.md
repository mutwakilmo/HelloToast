# HelloToast


## Summary

`View`,  `ViewGroup`, and layouts:

-   All UI elements are subclasses of the  [`View`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html)  class and therefore inherit many properties of the  `View`  superclass.
-   `View`  elements can be grouped inside a  [`ViewGroup`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewGroup.html), which acts as a container. The relationship is parent-child, in which the  _parent_  is a  `ViewGroup`, and the  _child_  is a  `View`  or another  `ViewGroup`.
-   The  [`onCreate()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onCreate(android.os.Bundle))  method is used to  _inflate the layout_, which means to set the content view of the screen to the XML layout. You can also use it to get references to other UI elements in the layout.
-   A  [`View`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html), like a string, is a resource that can have an id. The  [`findViewById`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html)  call takes the ID of a view as its parameter and returns the  `View`.

Using the layout editor:

-   Click the  **Design**  tab to manipulate elements and the layout, and the  **Text**  tab to edit the XML code for the layout.
-   In the  **Design**  tab, the  **Palettes**  pane shows UI elements that you can use in your app's layout, and the  **Component tree**  pane shows the view hierarchy of UI elements.
-   The design and blueprint panes of the layout editor show the UI elements in the layout.
-   The  **Attributes**  tab displays the  **Attributes**  pane for setting properties for a UI element.
-   Constraint handle: Click a constraint handle, shown as a circle on each side of an element, and then drag to another constraint handle or to parent boundary to create a constraint. The constraint is represented by the zigzag line.
-   Resizing handle: You can drag the square resizing handles to resize the element. While dragging, the handle changes to an angled corner.
-   When enabled, the Autoconnect tool automatically creates two or more constraints for a UI element to the parent layout. After you drag the element to the layout, it creates constraints based on the element's position.
-   You can remove constraints from an element by selecting the element and hovering your pointer over it to show the Clear Constraints  ![click the specific handle that sets the constraint. [IMAGEINFO]: remove_constraints_button.png](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-training-layout-editor-part-a/img/c5b4eebad60244c9.png)  button. Click this button to remove  _all_  constraints on the selected element. To clear a single constraint, click the specific handle that sets the constraint.
-   The  **Attributes**  pane offers access to all of the XML attributes you can assign to a UI element. It also includes a square sizing panel called the  _view inspector_  at the top. The symbols inside the square represent the height and width settings.

Setting layout width and height:

The  `layout_width`  and  `layout_height`  attributes change as you change the height and width size controls in the view inspector. These attributes can take one of three values for a  `ConstraintLayout`:

-   The  `match_constraint`  setting expands the view to fill its parent by width or heightâ€”up to a margin, if one is set.
-   The  `wrap_content`  setting shrinks the view dimensions so the view is just big enough to enclose its content. If there is no content, the view becomes invisible.
-   Use a fixed number of  `dp`  ([density-independent pixels](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities.html)) to specify a fixed size, adjusted for the screen size of the device.

Extracting string resources:

Instead of hard-coding strings, it is a best practice to use string resources, which represent the strings. Follow these steps:

1.  Click once on the hardcoded string to extract, press  **Alt-Enter**  (**Option-Enter**  on the Mac), and choose  **Extract string resources**  from the popup menu.
2.  Set the  **Resource name**`.`
3.  Click  **OK**. This creates a string resource in the  `values/res/string.xml`  file, and the string in your code is replaced with a reference to the resource:  `@string/button_label_toast`

Handling clicks:

-   A  _click handler_  is a method that is invoked when the user clicks or taps on a UI element.
-   Specify a click handler for a UI element such as a  `Button`  by entering its name in the  `onClick`  field in the  **Design**  tab's  **Attributes**  pane, or in the XML editor by adding the  `android:onClick`  property to a UI element such as a  `Button`.
-   Create the click handler in the main  `Activity`  using the  `View`  parameter. Example:  `public void showToast(View view) {/...}`.
-   You can find information on all  `Button`  properties in the  [Button class documentation](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Button.html), and all the  `TextView`  properties in the  [TextView class documentation](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html).

Displaying Toast messages:

A  [`Toast`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Toast.html)  provides a way to show a simple message in a small popup window. It fills only the amount of space required for the message. To create an instance of a  `Toast`, follow these steps:

1.  Call the  [`makeText()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Toast.html#makeText(android.content.Context,%20int,%20int))  factory method on the  [`Toast`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Toast.html)  class.
2.  Supply the  [context](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html)  of the app  `Activity`  and the message to display (such as a string resource).
3.  Supply the duration of the display, for example  [`Toast.LENGTH_SHORT`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Toast.html#LENGTH_SHORT)  for a short period. The duration can be either  `Toast.LENGTH_LONG`  or  `Toast.LENGTH_SHORT`.
4.  Show the  `Toast`  by calling  [`show()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Toast.html#show()).
